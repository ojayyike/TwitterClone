# TwitterClone

## Project Description

The Twitter Clone is a social network application that allows users to post short messages (tweets), follow other users, and receive updates on their newsfeed. It is built using Node.js, Socket IO, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, and CSS.

With the application, you can create your own social network that is similar to Twitter. You can sign up for an account, post tweets, and follow other users. You can also like and retweet tweets, and pin personal tweets to the top of twitter feed.

This application uses Socket IO to enable real-time communication between users, making it easy to stay up-to-date with the latest tweets and notifications. It also uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store and retrieve data, and HTML and CSS to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
